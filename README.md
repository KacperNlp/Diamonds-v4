# Diamonds
This is a simple game with 5 levels, where player has to pass required score of current level to unlock next level. Also each level has highest score and I use local storage to set and save it for each level.
~To increse score, player has to match diamonds with the same kind (kinds of diamonds: yellow, red, purple, white, green and blue (but 'blue' is only in 4 and 5 levels))

## About project
Game has 3 main layers (Main menu, board with levels and game map) and 2 side layers (settings and message after game with result).
* Levels layer - board with levels is generates every time when player will come in
* Game layer - each level doesn't have an assigned board/map with diamonds, this board is generates automatically when player opens the level.
kinds of diamonds in levels:
1,2 and 3 - 5 kinds (yellow, red, purple, white and green)
4 and 5 - 6 kinds (one more 'blue')
